				 programming is not only a tool for solving problems, 
				 but also a key to exploring the unknown world. 
				 As a classic language in the field of computer science, 
				 C language has always been favored by programming enthusiasts due to its high efficiency, 
				 flexibility, and powerful underlying control capabilities. 
				 In order to stimulate more people's interest in C language and enhance their programming skills, 
				 we have carefully created the "C Language Exploration Island" -
