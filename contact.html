            <h2>Current event information</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge Theme: National Youth Informatics Olympiad League (NOIP 2024)
            </br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting time: December 30, 2024 at 08:30
            </br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End time: 13:00, December 30, 2024
            </br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration deadline: As the registration deadline for NOIP 2024 is not 
                explicitly mentioned in the publicly released information, and registration for such events usually 
                ends some time earlier for organizers to prepare, an exact registration deadline cannot be given. 
                However, based on the date of the event (November 30, 2024), 
                it can be reasonably inferred that the registration deadline should be within a certain period of 
                time before the start of the event. It is recommended that interested participants closely follow 
                official notifications from the Chinese Computer Society (CCF) or relevant organizations to obtain 
                the most accurate registration information.
