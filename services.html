                <h2>How to learn C language?</h2>
                <div class="details">

                <p>Learning C language is a gradual process of accumulation and practice, 
                    which requires starting from mastering basic knowledge, 
                    practicing by writing simple programs, proficiently using programming tools, 
                    reading excellent code to learn specifications, delving into advanced topics such 
                    as memory management, pointer operations, and file I/O, participating in programming 
                    competitions and challenges to solve practical problems, continuously learning and 
                    communicating to expand knowledge and skills, and cultivating good study habits, 
                    persistently striving and practicing.

                <h2>Do you have any recommended learning resources for self-learning C language?</h2>
                <div class="details">
                    Questioner: Alex | Answerer: Eve | Date: March 30, 2024 | Number of likes: 3.5w

                <p>For students who want to deepen their learning of C language, 
                    I recommend a series of high-quality learning resources. 
                    Firstly, classic textbooks such as "C Programming Language" 
                    (K&R edition) are a must read for every C language learner, 
                    systematically introducing the basic knowledge and programming skills of the C language. 
                    In addition, there are many excellent online tutorials and video courses on the internet, 
                    such as C language courses on online education platforms like Coursera and edX, 
                    which help learners understand and master C language in a vivid and intuitive way. 
                    Meanwhile, open-source projects and communities on GitHub are also great places to learn C 
                    language. You can enhance your programming skills and practical experience by reading, 
                    participating, and contributing code. Finally, 
                    don't forget to utilize community resources such as forums and blogs to exchange 
                    experiences and skills with other C language learners and make progress together. 
                    I hope these learning resources can help you better master the C language and embark 
                    on your programming journey!</p>
